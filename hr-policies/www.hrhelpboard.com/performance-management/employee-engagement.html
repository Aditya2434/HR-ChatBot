<h1 xss="removed">Employee Engagement</h1>

<p xss="removed">Employee engagement refers to the level of commitment, passion, and motivation that employees have towards their work and their organization. It involves the degree to which employees feel connected to their company&#39;s mission, values, and goals, and are willing to go above and beyond to contribute to its success.</p>

<p xss="removed">Engaged employees are generally more productive, have higher job satisfaction, and are less likely to leave their <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/jobs-online/job-search.html">job</a>. They are also more likely to promote their organization and its products or services to others, which can positively impact the company&#39;s reputation and bottom line.</p>
